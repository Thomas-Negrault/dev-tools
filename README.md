# Why ?

I wanted to create a **React application** as a side project and I was tired of always searching on Google for tools like "base64 decoder", "uuid generator" and all that kind of little dev tools.

My idea was to create a **single web app** that will always be open in my
first browser tab.
I wanted the design to be **clean and simple to use**, as a lot of tools websites have an old look and feel. I also wanted to have a result as quickly as possible because the goal of this project is to save time.
